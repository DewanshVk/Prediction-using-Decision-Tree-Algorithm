# Prediction-using-Decision-Tree-Algorithm
Project Title: Predictive Analysis using Decision Tree Algorithm
<br>
Objective: To harness the predictive power of the Decision Tree Algorithm on a designated dataset.
<br>
Programming Language Utilized: Python
<br>
Throughout this internship, I had the privilege of immersing myself in data analysis and machine learning, using the Decision Tree Algorithm to unlock insights and predictions. I addressed key objectives, including:

Identifying meaningful patterns and decision rules within the data.
Training and evaluating the Decision Tree model for accurate predictions.
Exploring feature importance and interpretability of the model.
